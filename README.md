In daily P2P bidding, suppose your competitor’s price is 10,000. In theory, you only need to bid 10,001 to rank ahead of them. However, in real-world practice, manual price adjustments are neither precise nor sustainable over time. If you manually raise your price to 10,050, the extra 49 becomes an unnecessary additional cost.

[P2P Auto-Bidding Bot](https://apip2p.top)
 helps you solve this problem accurately and automatically:

Supports setting target users and a price-increase value. The system automatically scans competing ads and intelligently outbids them, keeping your ad consistently at the top.

Automatically adjusts ad prices dynamically based on market fluctuations, avoiding errors caused by manual intervention.

Automatically scans assets in your account, including BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, and XRP, and converts them into USDT with one click.

Allows you to directly modify all buy and sell ad parameters within the software interface, including price, inventory, and trade limits.

Automatically monitors your USDT balance and intelligently replenishes inventory for your sell ads, ensuring they remain active.

Currently, the software supports Binance and Bybit, and also offers customized development for other exchanges, such as:
OKX, HTX, Bitget, MEXC, Gate, KuCoin, Bitpapa, HodlHodl, and more.
